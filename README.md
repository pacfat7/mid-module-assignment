# mid-module-assignment CSCK531
This code demonstrates a recursive approach to Floyd's algorithm.  It demonstrates how recursion can be applied to classic algorithms in graph theory. 
# features
Calculation of shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a graph.
Use of Python's sys.maxsize to represent infinity for unreachable paths
# prerequisites
Python 3.x installed on your local machine or use a virtual IDE that supports Python, such as Repl.it.
# set up
## local IDE
Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone [https://github.com/pacfat7/mid-module-assignment.git]
Navigate to the cloned directory:
cd mid-module-assignment
Run the script:
python main.py
## virtual IDE
Log into your virtual IDE - [https://replit.it/]
Click the + Create button and select Import from GitHub.
Paste the URL of your GitHub repository [https://github.com/pacfat7/mid-module-assignment.git] and click Import.
Once imported, you can run the code directly in Repl.it's online IDE
# usuage
The script calculates the shortest paths matrix for a predefined graph defined in the main.py file. To use it with a different graph, modify the graph variable in main.py with the desired adjacency matrix (where sys.maxsize represents no direct path between vertices).
After running, the script outputs the shortest paths matrix to the console
